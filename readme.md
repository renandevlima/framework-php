# Simple MVC Framework using PHP

Simple PHP framework, ideal for small projects that don't need much backend. It can be used both with its own frontend and as a rest.

To use this framework, make the clone and after that enter your clone folder and run "composer update" to download the dependencies.

Its current configuration expects its own frontend, if you want to do it as Rest, follow the recommendations commented on index.php.

Also, to use the database, create a ".env" file and feed it as the ".env-example"
